# Consumer Complaint Sentiment Analysis (NLP)

## Overview
This project performs sentiment analysis on consumer complaint narratives using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. The goal is to understand customer sentiment (positive, negative, neutral) from real-world financial complaint data.

The project demonstrates text preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, sentiment labeling, and machine learning model training using Python.

---

## Dataset
- File: `Consumer_Complaints.csv`
- Description: Contains real consumer complaint narratives related to financial products and services.
- Note: The dataset is large (>100MB) and is tracked using Git Large File Storage (Git LFS).

---

## Key Steps Performed
1. Data loading and filtering of complaint narratives
2. Text preprocessing (cleaning, tokenization, stopword removal)
3. Sentiment labeling using NLP techniques
4. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
5. Machine learning model training and evaluation

---

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- NLTK
- Scikit-learn
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## How to Run the Project
1. Clone the repository
2. Ensure `Consumer_Complaints.csv` is present in the project folder
3. Open `project.ipynb` using Jupyter Notebook
4. Run cells sequentially

---

## Results
- Successfully classified consumer complaints into sentiment categories
- Gained insights into customer dissatisfaction patterns across products

---

## Future Improvements
- Use deep learning models (LSTM / Transformers)
- Improve sentiment labeling with supervised data
- Deploy as a web application
